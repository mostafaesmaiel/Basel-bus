## Product Research
> A brand is worthless if it doesn't **Connect** with the right audiences in a **relevant** way.

I think i did very well in this research. The main coloring is comming from this [image](http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/bus-ch/basel/basel-828-mt.jpg) where you can obviusly see two things : 
1- The green color is the main color for all busses in Basel and thats why i have choosed green with exact the same degree for the bus. To give him the same experince while using the app. 
2- The curvy design for the bus gives you the feeling comfort. Tried to not use any edges with the famous curvy font family (lato). Also implmented a curvey navigation bar so you can get the same expeirence.
